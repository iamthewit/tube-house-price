TODO:

- Add EntityInterface Class that ListingEntity implements

- Add generic EntityCollection class that ListingEntityCollection extends
    - Can add the array iterator stuff in here

- Split listing factory into two listing factories
    - one to create listings from listing entities
    - one to create listing entities from listings

- Add ListingService Class
    - Interact between repo and domain layer
    - Pull entities from the DB, transform them into domain objects
    - Pass domain listing objects into service, store the listing objects as listing entity objects in the repo

- Add validation to listing repository

- When testing use in memory sqlite db
    - run migrations before each test

- Add timestamps to ListingEntity (created_at, updated_at)

- Move tests into namespaced directories

- Add a router

General Notes:

Database

- Migrations system? Run migrations before tests

Listing Repository
