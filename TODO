TODO:

- Add ListingEntityCollection

- Add EntityInterface Class that ListingEntity implements

- Add generic EntityCollection class that ListingEntityCollection extends
    - Can add the array iterator stuff in here

- Move repository and entit code into the Application namespace

- Add ListingService Class
    - Interact between repo and domain layer
    - Pull entities from the DB, transform them into domain objects
    - Pass domain listing objects into service, store the listing objects as listing entity objects in the repo

- Add validation to listing repository

- Create Database Connection class
    - Class should be injected into repositories =
    - Class should use config values

    class Repository(SqliteConnection $connection) =

    class SqliteConnection(string $pathToDatabaseFile) =
        - class can hard code db type to sqlite =
        - can use DI to inject db path by checking value in config

    - When testing use in memory sqlite db
        - run migrations before each test
        - tear down db after each test

- config / environment variables

- Add timestamps to ListingEntity (created_at, updated_at)

- Move tests into namespaced directories

- Add a router

General Notes:
