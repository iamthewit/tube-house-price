TODO:

- Add validation to listing repository

- When testing use in memory sqlite db
    - run migrations before each test
    - tear down db after each test

- Add timestamps to ListingEntity (created_at, updated_at)
    - create a trait for this instead of adding to the interface? or make an abstract EntityTimestamps class?

- Move tests into namespaced directories

- Add a router

General Notes / Future Stuff:

Database
- Use in memory?
- Migrations system? Run migrations before tests

Listing Repository
- Find sources to seed the DB. Property websites etc

Listing Importer
- Create ListingImporter class to extract data from sources and prepare data to be stored in repository

Further down the line
- Add address as listing property

Static Analysis
 - PHPStan?
