TODO:

- Start using a router
    - setup routes for paging through listings, filtering listings

- Add some basic config
    - define paths (resource path, db path etc)

- Tests
    - Get in memory sqlite DB working for tests
    - Move some phpunit bootstrapped stuff into custom test case (setup and teardown)

- Add validation to listing repository

- Add timestamps to ListingEntity (created_at, updated_at)
    - create a trait for this instead of adding to the interface? or make an abstract EntityTimestamps class?

- Move tests into namespaced directories

General Notes / Future Stuff:

Listing Repository
- Find sources to seed the DB. Property websites etc

Listing Importer
- Create ListingImporter class to extract data from sources and prepare data to be stored in repository

Further down the line
- Add address as listing property

Static Analysis
 - PHPStan?
